# Java-Programming
This repository shows my java coding since September 2017, in which I began to learn java programming.
And now when I’m editing this text, I am totally a freshman in java programming.
And today, I’m gonna set a flag that I shall become a good java programmer in a year.
I hope I can prove myself a year later when I reopen and edit this message.
This repository will be quite crowded in a short time.
